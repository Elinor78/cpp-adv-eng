# SCOPE AND PURPOSE
The overall aim of this project is to create a useful meeting-scheduling platform that will enable employees to quickly, easily, and effectively schedule meetings. Any employee will be able to schedule a meeting by selecting the employees they wish to invite through a user-friendly GUI interface. A time slot during which all invited employees are available will then be selected by the user, taking into consideration other meetings the employees are attending and the times they are available (thereby preventing employees from being double-booked in multiple meetings). Finally, any available meeting room that is large enough to accommodate all the invited employees at the time specified will be chosen by the user; if there is no room available for the given time and employees, then the program will inform the user of this exception. 

## The scope of the system shall include 
- Scheduling the meeting in efficient way.
- Gathering the feedback from attendee.
- Cancelling the meeting. 
- Changing the meeting schedule and/or location.
- Scheduling concurrent meetings in timely manner.
- Conducting virtual meetings.
- Confirming the location and time of the meeting.
- Minimize users effort in co-ordinating and scheduling meetings

## Project Purpose
- The meeting scheduler will allow users to effectively manage the main aspects of scheduling software system. The meeting scheduler will allow its user to:
  - Create and manage appointment
  - Schedule future appointments
  - Manage employee schedule
  - Update and delete rooms
  - Analyze project report cost
